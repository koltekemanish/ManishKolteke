Traffic control system

Traffic control system will evaluate number of car(or any vehicle) waiting at the intersection in each direction at each seconds
for user's first N seconds input. 

This system works now for ONE or TWO way combination road(Straight line) but it will be modify according to our requirement.
In this project, three type of signal lights are use(GREEN, YELLOW and RED), but only two lights are apply for calculating 
 intersection in each direction.
